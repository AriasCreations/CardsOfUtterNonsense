Some parts of the codebase refer to the game as Cards Against Humanity


During development this was the working codename, and I sent a email to Cards Against Humanity, seeking permission to use the name for this game. After permission was denied, the name was quickly changed to Cards of Utter Nonsense.

The name in the files here will not be updated to reflect this change as some of these are old development versions i have archived and open sourced. DO NOT USE AS IS. I cannot stress that strongly enough. Permission was not granted which is why i changed the name after v1 fully came out. v2 was the effort to fully change the name in other places like the database.
